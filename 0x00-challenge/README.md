PROJECT Fix My Code Challenge: #SOLUTIONS

Fix my code is a new kind of project in which we will enter into an already-existing code base and make necessary changes!



The language will be known to you occasionally, and not always.



Kindly get the 0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge repository and utilize it as the starting point for all solution files.



Just fix it instead of recoding everything!
